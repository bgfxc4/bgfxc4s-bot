## bgfxc4s Discord-Bot

this is a little experiment by me, testing out the Discord.js library.

All you have to do is add an 'Configs' directory with an config.json file in it.
You need to add an string "prefix" which is gonna used as prefix and an string "token" with the private token of your Discord bot.
It could look like this:

```JSON
{
	"token":"YourPrivateToken",
	"prefix":"!!"
}
```
