## bgfxc4s Discord-Bot

this is a little experiment by me, testing out the Discord.js library.

All you have to do is add an "config.json" file in the "configs" directory.
You need to add an string "prefix" which is gonna used as prefix, an string "ownerID" with your discord ID and an string "token" with the private token of your Discord bot to this config.json,
or simply rename the "example_config.json" to "config.json" and edit the parameters.
It could look like this:

```JSON
{
	"token":"YourPrivateToken",
	"prefix":"!!",
    "userID":"YourDiscordId"
}
```
